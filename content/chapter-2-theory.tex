\chapter{Theoretical Foundations}
\label{sec:theory}
Before presenting the approach for tackling AutoML with an ensemble of optimizers, some theoretical foundations of both elements, AutoML and optimization, are given in the following.
This theoretical background is structured in three parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Some basic concepts and intuitions of machine learning in general are outlined alongside with the challenges and problems that arise when applying machine learning.
    \item The concepts and usual approaches of AutoML are introduced, which were developed to tackle the listed challenges of classical machine learning. In addition, the connection between the AutoML setting and typical optimization problems is illustrated.
    \item As the foundation for building an ensemble of optimizers a selection of established optimization methods is given and explained.
\end{enumerate}
The overview of optimization methods is concluded with the discussion of a theoretical drawback of using a single optimization method.
This discussion of a possible disadvantage is used as a starting point for the line of reasoning why an ensemble of optimizers is an approach to counteract this drawback.
Before explaining the ensemble approach in the next chapter, this line of reasoning is continued with a selection of related works, where other approaches that addressed this theoretical disadvantage of using a single optimization method are mentioned.
