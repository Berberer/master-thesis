# Masters Thesis: Optimizer Ensembles for Automated Machine Learning

Thesis about an AutoML approach with two core ideas:
* Model selection as a HTN planning problem searched via an MCTS, which allows the creation of more complex pipelines
* Model configuration via an ensemble of different optimization approaches to detect and afterwards exploit the most suitable optimizer for the given input dataset

This approach has a [reference implementation](https://github.com/Berberer/frankensteins-automl) for direct usage.
